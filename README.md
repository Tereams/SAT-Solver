# Einstein Riddle SAT Solver

This repository contains a Python implementation of a SAT solver using the DPLL algorithm to solve Einstein's Riddle. The project includes the main SAT solver implementation, a script for encoding Einstein's Riddle into CNF (DIMACS format), and the resulting encoded CNF file.


## Overview

Einstein's Riddle, also known as the Zebra Puzzle, is a logic puzzle that is solvable using constraint satisfaction techniques. This project demonstrates how to represent the problem as a Boolean SAT problem and solve it using a Python-based SAT solver.

## Project Structure

- `dpll.py`: Implementation of the SAT solver using the DPLL algorithm with heuristics.
- `gen_riddle.py`: A script that encodes Einstein's Riddle into the CNF format.
- `einstein_riddle.cnf`: The resulting CNF file generated by `gen_riddle.py`, ready to be solved by the SAT solver.

## How to Use

### 1. Encoding the Puzzle

Run the `gen_riddle.py` script to generate the DIMACS CNF file (`einstein_riddle.cnf`) for Einstein's Riddle.

```bash
python gen_riddle.py
```

This will produce a file `einstein_riddle.cnf` in the same directory.

### 2. Running the Solver

Use `dpll.py` to solve the CNF file. The script reads the CNF file and attempts to find a satisfying assignment.

```bash
python dpll.py
```

The output will indicate whether the formula is satisfiable and, if so, provide the satisfying assignment.
